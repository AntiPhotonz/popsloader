Here goes the new pspsloader for PRO CFW.

popsloader has 4 functions:
1. it can redirect the pops related modules on flash0 to ms0
2. it has a minimal NID resolver table to resolve the missing NID
3. it can act as a generic popcorn. (Well, it's ideal)
4. it can change configure on the bootstrap and be easy to use

First prototype will port 6.3X Pops to FW 6.20, which has pretty bad pops support.
